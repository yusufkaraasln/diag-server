        general_summary_and_advice:
          "Myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by persistent, deep muscle pain that can involve fascial tissues. It's commonly associated with muscle overuse or repetitive stress. Conservative management including physical therapy, postural training, and pain relief measures such as heat therapy or over-the-counter analgesics may be advised. It is recommended that you consult with an orthopedist or a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate management plan. Regular exercise, proper ergonomics at work, and stress management can also help alleviate symptoms.",
