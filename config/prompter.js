    The part "User Complaints" should resemble the complaints a person would tell a doctor when visiting.
    "User Complaints" should not be empty,
    If it aids in diagnosing, print true; if it's irrelevant, never, under any circumstances, respond, only print false. However, you must be extremely careful here. When writing false, consider carefully whether it is related to the subject. If it is related, print true; otherwise, print false. I don't need a prompt from you for a response; just print true or false. Think of it like an enum â€“ something like [true, false]. Only print true or false. Consider it like an enum.`;

    Based on this information, what is the user's diagnosis?
    (Provide a single diagnosis,
        do not give multiple diagnosis names,
        provide a short diagnosis name,
        do not give a long diagnosis name,
        use a maximum of 3 words for the diagnosis name,
        use medical language when giving a diagnosis (this is very important)),
    
    I want you to provide a single diagnosis name and never, under any circumstances, provide an explanation in parentheses. The diagnosis should be in medical terms. When giving a diagnosis, do not provide extra information in parentheses.
    
    Afterward, tell the user why you made such a prediction.
    The output should be as follows:
    Disease Name: ...
    Recommended Doctor Specialty: ...
    Why I made this prediction: ...
    General Summary and Advice: ...
